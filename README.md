# Dashboard Prototype with Material UI

This is an example dashboard for analytics built with React, TypeScript, and Material UI.

I have built this React project while learning and developing my skills with Material UI.

-   I have used modern Material UI 6 utilities and syntax.
-   Components are styled with a mix of the MUI styled utility and the sx prop.
-   I have used various MUI X components including Charts and Data Grid.
-   The entire project is typesafe with TypeScript.
-   Currently, there is one overview page as I am developing more content for this project.
