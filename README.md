# Dashboard Prototype with Material UI

This is an example dashboard for analytics built with React, TypeScript, and Material UI.

I have built this React project while learning and developing my skills with Material UI.

-   I have used modern Material UI 6 components and syntax.
-   Components are styled with both the MUI styled utility and the sx prop.
-   I have used various MUI X components including Charts and Data Grid.
-   The entire project is built using TypeScript.
-   Currently, there is one overview page as I am developing more content for this project.

## The Process

I created this project as an exercise to further develop my knowledge of Material UI. Having sufficient React experience, as well as other frontend frameworks such as TailwindCSS and Bootstrap, I was able to grasp Material UI’s concepts and find the solutions I needed with ease.

I began planning out the project by finding references of how I wanted the final product to look. Since I was just focusing on using the framework, I wouldn’t need to dive into Figma to do a complete design. To get an idea of different types of layouts, I referred to designs on Dribbble and made note of commonalities between them, what features I thought looked good, and the colours and styles that were being used.

To complete this project, I needed to understand more about how Material UI works and what is considered best practice. I spent a lot of the development process improving my knowledge by reading and inspecting example code within the Material UI documentation, referring to each component’s API as needed.

The main challenge of this project was identifying the best way to use the framework to get the desired result. For example, figuring out how to create a theme for both light and dark modes and then apply the styles consistently on various customised components. To give the dashboard the intended look and feel, I consulted the MUI documentation and used a theme creation tool that made visualising the colours and fonts fast and simple. As a result, I have significantly expanded my understanding of the framework by giving adequate attention and focus to each component as I used it.

Another development challenge I faced was a need for some functionality that is not included within Material UI. I wanted a custom scroll bar in the side navigation to replace the browser’s default. To do this, I found an example in another dashboard and used the developer tools to inspect it and see what I could learn. Based on the CSS classes, I could then find the correct npm package with a quick Google search. I was then able to install and integrate the custom scroll bar into my project to solve the issue.

Overall, this project has helped me take my skills with Material UI to a new level. While I didn’t come up against any challenges that were too difficult, this project allowed me to invest the time needed to fully grasp what it is like to work with Material UI. I have improved my skills as a developer and added yet another tool to my toolbelt, and I look forward to continuing to work with Material UI in the future.
